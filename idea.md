# Idea

Classes have properties. Properties can be internal or external.
External properties describe interactions with other classes.
Internal properties are related only to the given class itself.

Objects interact in the way defined by their classes external
properties. Interactions result in system's model change.

Real system changes as well, we trace and analyze the changes
(using ANY methods, different topic).
We force update the system's model (by making manual changes)
to make it similar to real system.

This core analyzes the difference and stores some useful frame.
After getting solid base of manual changes, the core finds patterns.

Using these patterns it suggests changes to classes external properties.

Benefits: find potentially new unknown interactions & improve modeling
(next time you will not need to make these changes manually again).
